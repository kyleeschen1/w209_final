# Exploring Voter Behavior

## A Final Project for MIDS w209, Summer Semester by Kyle Eschen and Tej Singh

We created this series of visualizations to expore US voter participation and choices in national elections from 1976 to 2018. Using data from the Federal Election Commission, we've designed a number of exercises and graphics to help viewers understand the complexity behind summarizing the manifold ebbs and flows of voter acitivity.
